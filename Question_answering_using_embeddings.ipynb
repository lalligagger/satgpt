    "## Full procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook demonstrates the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare search data (once)\n",
    "    1. Collect: We'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics\n",
    "    2. Chunk: Documents are split into short, mostly self-contained sections to be embedded\n",
    "    3. Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API\n",
    "    4. Store: Embeddings are saved (for large datasets, use a vector database)\n",
    "2. Search (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Given a user question, generate an embedding for the query from the OpenAI API\n",
    "    2. Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query\n",
    "3. Ask (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Insert the question and the most relevant sections into a message to GPT\n",
    "    2. Return GPT's answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Because GPT is more expensive than embeddings search, a system with a high volume of queries will have its costs dominated by step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `gpt-3.5-turbo` using ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.002 per query, or ~500 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\n",
    "- For `gpt-4`, again assuming ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.03 per query, or ~30 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, exact costs will depend on the system specifics and usage patterns."
